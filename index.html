                <p>Problem</p>
                <p>According to a study in 2022, the agricultural sector employed about 50% of the workforce yet only contributed to 17-18% of Indiaâ€™s overall GDP.With the erratic changes in the environment, soil testing can be a tedious task, inaccurate manual analysis could lead to loss of crops and low productivity on a large scale coupled with infertility of soil and soil erosion </p>
                <p>Solution</p>
                <p>To determine the soil characteristics we require the use of a robot crane with sensors such as NPK, temperature, humidity, tilt and moisture. The measured data is run through machine learning model and a report is produced which determines the best crop to grow in the given soil</p>
